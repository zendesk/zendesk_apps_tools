# IN MAINTENANCE MODE

Zendesk Apps Tools is in maintenance mode. This means no additional feature enhancements or non-security bugs will be fixed. **We recommend switching to using [ZCLI](https://github.com/zendesk/zcli) for our best CLI experience.**


# Zendesk Apps Tools

## Description
Zendesk Apps Tools (ZAT) are a collection of local development tools that simplify building and deploying [Zendesk apps](https://developer.zendesk.com/apps/docs/apps-v2/getting_started).

## Owners
This repo is owned and maintained by the Zendesk Apps team. You can reach us on vegemite@zendesk.com. We are located in Melbourne.

## Install and use ZAT
ZAT is a Ruby gem. You don't need to know Ruby to use the tools but you do need to install Ruby to install the gem.

To install, run `gem install zendesk_apps_tools`.

To get the latest version, run `gem update zendesk_apps_tools`.

For information on using the tools, see  [Zendesk App Tools](https://developer.zendesk.com/apps/docs/developer-guide/zat) on developer.zendesk.com.

## Work on ZAT
If you want to help **develop** this tool, clone this repo and run `bundle install`.

If you receive this error:
    Installing nokogiri 1.10.10 with native extensions
    Gem::Ext::BuildError: ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.
Then run `gem install nokogiri -- --use-system-libraries` followed by run `bundle config build.nokogiri --use-system-libraries` and try running `bundle install` again.

ZAT uses a gem called [ZAS](https://github.com/zendesk/zendesk_apps_support/). If you're developing ZAT, you'll probably want to edit code in ZAS too. To do so, you need to clone the ZAS repo and add the following line at the end of `Gemfile` in the ZAT project:

`gem 'zendesk_apps_support', path: '../zendesk_apps_support'`

Then, comment-out the line referring to `zendesk_apps_support` in this project's `.gemspec` file.

```
# s.add_runtime_dependency 'zendesk_apps_support', '~> X.YY.ZZ'
```

The path should point to your local ZAS directory. In this way, your clone of ZAT will use a local version of ZAS, which is very helpful for development. Run a `bundle install` after changing the Gemfile.

## Deploy ZAT

* To bump ZAT version, run `bump patch|minor|major --no-bundle` from the root directory. **Note:** `--no-bundle` is required in order to prevent `bundle update` command from running, which is by default triggered by the [bump](https://github.com/gregorym/bump) gem and could lead to incompatible dependencies.
* To publish ZAT to [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/zendesk_apps_tools), run `bundle exec rake release`.

## Testing
This project uses rspec, which you can run with `bundle exec rake`.

## Contribute
Improvements are always welcome. To contribute:
